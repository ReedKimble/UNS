# 7. Constraints and Limits of the Calculus

This section makes explicit the **constraints and limits** of the UNS-C calculus. These limits are essential to preserving the calculus as a formal tool rather than allowing it to drift into ontology, semantics, or application.

UNS-C is defined as much by what it does *not* do as by what it permits.

---

## 7.1 No Ontological Authority

**Constraint:** UNS-C makes no ontological claims.

The calculus does not assert that any structure, transformation, or invariant corresponds to reality, existence, or necessity. All ontological commitments lie upstream and are presupposed, not established, by UNS-C.

Failure, inconsistency, or inadequacy of the calculus has no bearing on ontological claims articulated elsewhere in the corpus.

---

## 7.2 No Semantic Interpretation

**Constraint:** UNS-C does not assign meaning.

Transformations, equivalence classes, and invariants defined by the calculus do not encode meaning, truth, intention, or value. Any semantic interpretation applied to UNS-C structures or processes is external and contingent.

The calculus itself remains agnostic with respect to interpretation.

---

## 7.3 No Temporal or Causal Commitments

**Constraint:** UNS-C does not model time or causality.

Ordered transformation sequences are not timelines, histories, or causal chains. The calculus provides no notion of temporal duration, simultaneity, causation, or dependency in the physical or metaphysical sense.

Any temporal or causal reading belongs entirely to downstream frameworks.

---

## 7.4 No Dynamics or Optimization

**Constraint:** UNS-C does not encode dynamics, optimization, or preference.

The calculus does not specify which transformations should occur, which sequences are preferred, or which outcomes are optimal. It specifies only which transformations are admissible.

Selection, evaluation, or optimization criteria are external to UNS-C.

---

## 7.5 No Universality or Completeness Claims

**Constraint:** UNS-C does not claim universality or completeness.

The calculus is not asserted to capture all possible transformations, processes, or structural evolutions compatible with UNS. Other calculi may exist that emphasize different properties or operational goals.

UNS-C is one calculus among many, not a final or exhaustive one.

---

## 7.6 Dependence on Grammar Integrity

**Constraint:** UNS-C presupposes the integrity of UNS.

If the grammar defined by UNS is altered, restricted, or replaced, UNS-C may no longer be applicable without modification. The calculus does not adapt itself to changes in the grammar.

This dependence is explicit and intentional.

---

## 7.7 Limits of Formal Resolution

**Constraint:** UNS-C resolves only formal admissibility.

Questions about significance, interpretation, correctness, usefulness, or truth are not answerable within the calculus. UNS-C determines only whether a transformation or sequence is admissible under its rules.

---

## 7.8 Summary

The limits of UNS-C can be summarized as follows:

- It carries no ontological authority
- It assigns no semantic meaning
- It encodes no time, causality, or dynamics
- It specifies no preferences or optimizations
- It claims no universality or completeness

These constraints preserve UNS-C as a precise, replaceable calculus. Respecting them ensures that the calculus remains a tool for formal transformation rather than a surrogate theory.

The following sections, if included, provide illustrative examples and downstream references without extending the scope defined here.
