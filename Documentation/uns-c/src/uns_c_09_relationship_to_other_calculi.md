# 9. Relationship to Other Calculi

This section situates the UNS-C calculus relative to other formal calculi. The intent is contextual, not comparative. UNS-C does not claim priority, optimality, or generality with respect to alternative calculi.

UNS-C is defined entirely by the grammar it presupposes and the transformation rules it specifies. Any relationship to other calculi must be understood within those limits.

---

## 9.1 Non-Competitive Posture

UNS-C does not compete with established calculi in mathematics, logic, computer science, or physics. It does not aim to subsume them, improve upon them, or replace them.

Where similarities exist, they arise from shared structural concerns rather than derivation or reduction. UNS-C is not proposed as a universal calculus or as a foundational replacement for other formalisms.

---

## 9.2 Dependence on Underlying Grammar

Calculi are inseparable from the grammars over which they are defined. UNS-C is explicitly tied to the Universal Number Set.

Other calculi may operate over different grammars, even when addressing superficially similar notions such as transformation, equivalence, or process. Differences between calculi often reflect differences in grammatical assumptions rather than differences in expressive power.

---

## 9.3 Independence from Semantic Frameworks

Many calculi are designed to support semantic interpretation, proof, evaluation, or optimization. UNS-C is not.

This distinction should not be read as a deficiency. UNS-C intentionally avoids semantic commitments so that it may be embedded, if desired, within multiple downstream interpretive frameworks without modification.

---

## 9.4 No Claim of Completeness or Minimality

UNS-C does not claim to be complete with respect to all admissible transformations over UNS, nor minimal in any absolute sense.

Alternative calculi may define different primitive transformations, equivalence relations, or invariants while remaining compatible with the same grammar. Such calculi do not contradict UNS-C; they occupy different positions in the design space.

---

## 9.5 Compatibility and Coexistence

UNS-C may coexist with other calculi applied to UNS structures, provided dependencies are respected.

Multiple calculi may be applied sequentially or in parallel, each introducing its own transformation rules and induced equivalences. UNS-C does not preclude such coexistence and does not claim exclusivity.

---

## 9.6 Summary

The relationship between UNS-C and other calculi is characterized by:

- Non-competition
- Grammar dependence
- Semantic neutrality
- Acceptance of plurality

UNS-C should be evaluated solely on whether it fulfills its stated role as a calculus over UNS, not on how it compares to alternative formalisms.

The following section, if included, identifies downstream uses of UNS-C by reference only, without conferring justificatory authority.
