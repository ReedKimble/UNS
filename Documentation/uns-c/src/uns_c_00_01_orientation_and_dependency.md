# 0. Orientation and Scope

UNS-C is a **calculus defined over the Universal Number Set (UNS)**. Its purpose is to specify admissible transformations, compositions, and equivalences of structures that are expressible within the grammar provided by UNS.

UNS-C does not introduce ontological claims, semantic interpretation, or empirical validation. It does not describe reality, assign meaning, or explain phenomena. Its role is strictly formal and operational: given structures defined in UNS, UNS-C specifies how those structures may be transformed while remaining admissible.

Accordingly, UNS-C should not be read as a theory, model, or explanatory framework. It is a rule system. Its success is measured by internal coherence, closure under its operations, and fidelity to the constraints imposed by the underlying grammar.

The scope of UNS-C is deliberately limited. It does not decide which transformations are meaningful, useful, or correct in any external domain. Such judgments arise only when the calculus is embedded within downstream interpretive, computational, or operational contexts, none of which are part of this document.

Nothing in UNS-C is required for the ontology articulated in *Vorticity Space* to hold. Nothing in UNS-C is required for the grammar defined by UNS to remain valid. UNS-C is optional machinery, introduced solely to formalize structured change over UNS expressions.

# 1. Dependency, Posture, and Replaceability

UNS-C occupies a strictly downstream position within the corpus. The direction of dependency is one-way:

**Ontological necessity → Formal grammar (UNS) → Calculus (UNS-C)**

UNS-C presupposes the existence of UNS structures and operates exclusively on objects defined by that grammar. It does not constrain the ontology and does not retroactively justify the grammar. Failure, revision, or replacement of UNS-C has no impact on the validity of UNS or on the ontological claims established elsewhere.

The rules defined in UNS-C are conditional. They specify what transformations are admissible *if* one adopts UNS as a grammar. They do not claim that these transformations are uniquely correct, exhaustive, or required.

Multiple calculi may be defined over the same grammar. UNS-C is one such calculus, selected for its ability to preserve closure, asymmetry, and reflexive admissibility under transformation. Alternative calculi may emphasize different properties or operational goals without contradiction.

This posture has several implications:

- Formal success within UNS-C does not validate ontology or grammar.
- Formal failure within UNS-C does not undermine ontology or grammar.
- Equivalence defined by UNS-C is structural, not semantic.
- Direction or ordering induced by the calculus carries no temporal or causal meaning.

Readers should therefore treat UNS-C as **machinery**, not foundation. It is a set of rules governing motion over structure, nothing more. With this dependency and posture fixed, the sections that follow introduce the objects, transformations, and limits of the calculus itself.
