# 7. Expressive Scope and Limits

This section clarifies the **expressive scope** of the Universal Number Set and delineates its **limits**. These boundaries are essential to prevent the grammar from being misread as a theory, a model of reality, or a universal formal substrate.

UNS is evaluated by what it is designed to express—and by what it explicitly does not attempt to express.

---

## 7.1 What UNS Is Designed to Express

UNS is designed to express **structural constraints** consistent with a relational, asymmetric, closed, and reflexive ontology. Within that remit, the grammar can represent:

- Relational structure without intrinsic identity
- Differentiation arising from context and position
- Asymmetric and directional relations
- Closed operations and compositional construction
- Structural self-reference without meta-language

These capabilities define the intended expressive territory of UNS. When used within this territory, the grammar functions as specified.

---

## 7.2 What UNS Does Not Express

UNS does not attempt to express:

- Physical laws, quantities, or measurements
- Causal mechanisms or dynamics
- Semantic meaning, truth, or interpretation
- Empirical prediction or explanation
- Ontological necessity or metaphysical grounding

Any such interpretation applied to UNS constructions is external to the grammar and belongs to downstream frameworks or applications.

---

## 7.3 No Claim of Universality

Despite its name, the Universal Number Set does not claim to be a universal formal system in the mathematical or philosophical sense.

“Universal” here denotes breadth of **structural expressibility** under the stated constraints, not completeness with respect to all possible formalisms or domains. Other grammars may satisfy the same ontological constraints in different ways.

UNS does not compete with alternative formal systems; it exemplifies one viable construction.

---

## 7.4 Conditional Adequacy

The adequacy of UNS is conditional:

- If one adopts the ontological constraints presupposed here, UNS provides a grammar capable of expressing them.
- If one rejects those constraints, UNS has no special standing.

This conditionality is intentional. UNS does not seek to persuade adoption through expressive reach or technical sophistication.

---

## 7.5 Limits of Formal Resolution

UNS does not resolve philosophical questions about meaning, truth, paradox, or interpretation. It specifies only the **well-formedness** of structures within the grammar.

Questions about whether a construction is meaningful, useful, or applicable arise only when the grammar is embedded in a broader interpretive or operational context.

---

## 7.6 Proper Use and Misuse

Proper use of UNS involves:

- Treating it as a grammar, not a theory
- Evaluating constructions by admissibility, not truth
- Embedding it deliberately within downstream contexts

Misuse includes:

- Treating UNS as ontological foundation
- Interpreting formal success as validation of reality claims
- Expecting empirical or semantic resolution from the grammar alone

---

## 7.7 Summary

The Universal Number Set has a clearly bounded role:

- It expresses structural constraints
- It assumes, but does not justify, ontology
- It enables formal construction without semantic commitment

Respecting these limits preserves both the rigor of the grammar and the integrity of the ontological foundation it presupposes.

The following sections address illustrative usage and downstream positioning, without extending the expressive scope defined here.
