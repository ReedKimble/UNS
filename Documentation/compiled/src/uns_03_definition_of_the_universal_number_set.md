# 3. Definition of the Universal Number Set

This section defines the Universal Number Set (UNS) as a formal structure that satisfies the constraints outlined in Section 2. The definition is intentionally minimal. It introduces only those elements required to specify the grammar unambiguously and to support the expressive roles UNS is intended to play.

Nothing in this definition asserts ontological truth. The structures defined here are formal objects within a grammar. Their relevance derives solely from their capacity to express relational, asymmetric, closed, and reflexive structure when such expression is desired.

## 3.1 Informal Characterization

Informally, the Universal Number Set is a set of elements together with a collection of relations and operations such that:

- Elements have no intrinsic identity independent of their relations
- Relations are primitive and need not be reducible to functions over pre-defined objects
- Operations are closed over the set
- The structure admits reflexive constructions without appeal to an external meta-language

This characterization is descriptive only. The formal definition below makes these properties precise without expanding their scope.

## 3.2 Underlying Set and Elements

UNS begins with an underlying set, denoted here abstractly as **U**. Elements of **U** are not interpreted as numbers in the conventional sense, nor as representations of quantities or magnitudes.

An element of **U** has no meaning in isolation. Its role is defined entirely by the relations and operations in which it participates. No element is designated as a distinguished origin, unit, or reference point.

---

## 3.3 Primitive Relations

A finite collection of primitive relations is defined on **U**. These relations are taken as basic and are not derived from more fundamental constructs.

The grammar does not require that these relations be symmetric, transitive, or otherwise constrained beyond what is explicitly specified. Asymmetry is permitted at the foundational level, and equivalence is not assumed unless imposed by a specific relation.

Primitive relations are the primary means by which differentiation is expressed within UNS.

---

## 3.4 Operations and Closure

UNS includes a defined set of operations acting on elements and relations of **U**. Each operation is required to be closed: applying an operation to admissible inputs yields an output that remains within the domain of the grammar.

Operations may combine, transform, or relate existing elements, but they do not introduce elements from outside **U**, nor do they require external evaluators to be well-defined.

---

## 3.5 Reflexive Constructions

The grammar permits constructions in which relations or operations may take as arguments structures that include themselves, directly or indirectly.

This reflexive capacity is constrained by the requirement of closure. Reflexive constructions are treated as ordinary elements or relations within **U**, subject to the same rules as all others. No separate meta-level is introduced.

The definition does not require that all possible self-referential constructions be admissible; only that reflexivity is not excluded by design.

---

## 3.6 Identity as Structural Position

Within UNS, identity is structural rather than intrinsic. Two elements are distinct only insofar as they occupy different positions within the relational and operational structure of the grammar.

No global labeling scheme or absolute identifier is assumed. Distinction arises from relational context alone.

---

## 3.7 Formal Summary

Formally, the Universal Number Set consists of:

- An underlying set **U**
- A finite set of primitive relations defined on **U**
- A finite set of closed operations acting within **U**
- Rules permitting reflexive construction under closure

Together, these components define a grammar capable of expressing the constraints specified in Section 2. The precise symbolic realization of these components is introduced in subsequent sections where necessary.

This definition is intentionally open-ended. It specifies what UNS must provide, not a unique way of providing it. Alternative formal realizations that satisfy the same constraints are possible and do not compete ontologically with this one.
