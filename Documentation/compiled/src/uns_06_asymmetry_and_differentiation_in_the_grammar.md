# 6. Asymmetry and Differentiation in the Grammar

This section specifies how **asymmetry and differentiation** are handled within the Universal Number Set as formal properties of the grammar. The purpose here is not to argue for the necessity of asymmetry—that work is ontological and has already been done—but to clarify how a grammar that assumes asymmetry must represent it.

Asymmetry, in UNS, is not treated as a deviation from symmetry or as a feature introduced by special cases. It is treated as a first-class structural capability of the grammar.

## 6.1 Differentiation Without Global Equivalence

**Property:** The grammar does not impose global equivalence by default.

UNS does not assume that elements or relations are interchangeable unless explicitly specified. Equality, equivalence, or symmetry must be introduced through particular relations or constructions; they are not granted a priori.

This allows differentiation to arise structurally rather than being treated as an exception to an otherwise symmetric system.

---

## 6.2 Directional and Non-Invertible Relations

**Property:** Relations need not be invertible.

The grammar permits relations for which reversal does not yield an equivalent relation. Directionality, ordering, or precedence may be encoded directly, without requiring additional machinery to break symmetry.

This property ensures that the grammar can represent oriented structure and non-reciprocal relations as foundational, not derived.

---

## 6.3 Local Symmetry, Global Asymmetry

**Property:** Symmetry is local and conditional.

While UNS permits symmetric relations, such symmetry is always specific to a given relation or construction. The grammar does not enforce symmetry at the global level.

This distinction allows symmetric patterns to be expressed against a background of asymmetry, preserving differentiation at the system level.

---

## 6.4 Structural Ordering Without External Frames

**Property:** Ordering arises internally.

Any notion of order, sequence, or hierarchy expressed within UNS must be generated through relations internal to the grammar. No external ordering principle, index, or coordinate system is assumed.

This property prevents the introduction of privileged reference frames while still allowing complex differentiated structure.

---

## 6.5 Persistence of Distinction

**Property:** Differentiation can be maintained under composition.

Once distinctions are established through relations or operations, subsequent constructions need not collapse them unless explicitly defined to do so. Differentiation persists unless a relation enforces equivalence.

This allows structured patterns to remain stable across extended constructions within the grammar.

---

## 6.6 Asymmetry as Structural Capability

Taken together, these properties ensure that UNS is capable of expressing asymmetry as a structural feature of the grammar rather than as an emergent artifact or special condition.

The grammar does not privilege symmetry, neutrality, or equivalence as defaults. It permits them where useful, but does not require them.

---

## 6.7 Summary

Asymmetry and differentiation in UNS are realized through:

- Absence of default global equivalence
- Support for non-invertible relations
- Local, conditional symmetry
- Internally generated ordering
- Persistence of distinction under composition

These features allow UNS to serve as a grammar for expressing oriented, differentiated structure consistent with the ontological constraints it presupposes.

The next section addresses the expressive scope and limits of the grammar, making explicit what UNS is and is not intended to capture.
