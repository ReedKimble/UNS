# 2. Formal Assumptions and Constraints

This section specifies the **formal assumptions and constraints** under which the Universal Number Set (UNS) is constructed. These are not axioms about reality, nor are they claims of logical or mathematical necessity. They are conditions imposed on the grammar so that it is capable of expressing the ontological invariants it presupposes.

Each assumption answers the question: *What must a formal system be able to do if it is to serve as an adequate grammar for a relational, asymmetric, closed, and reflexive ontology?*

The assumptions below are therefore conditional. If one adopts a different ontological posture, a different set of formal constraints may be appropriate. UNS does not claim exclusivity.

## 2.1 Relational Expressibility

**Constraint:** The grammar must represent relations as primitive, not reducible to collections of independently defined elements.

This constraint ensures that relational structure can be expressed without presupposing self-contained atomic units. Any formalism in which relations are secondary constructions over prior objects would be incompatible with the intended expressive role of UNS.

Formally, this means that the grammar must be capable of specifying relational structure directly, rather than encoding relations solely as derived mappings between independently meaningful symbols.

---

## 2.2 Differentiation Without Intrinsic Identity

**Constraint:** The grammar must allow differentiation without requiring intrinsic identity.

UNS must be able to distinguish structure through relational contrast alone. Symbols or elements within the grammar may not rely on intrinsic labels, fixed types, or absolute identifiers to establish difference. Differentiation must arise from position, relation, or structure within the system.

This constraint excludes formalisms that depend on externally imposed naming or typing as their primary means of distinction.

---

## 2.3 Asymmetry Representation

**Constraint:** The grammar must be capable of representing asymmetry as a structural property, not as an exception or perturbation.

UNS must encode directional or non-equivalent relations without treating symmetry as the default state that is later broken. Asymmetry must be representable at the foundational level of the grammar.

This requirement does not specify how asymmetry is encoded symbolically; it specifies only that the grammar cannot collapse all relations into equivalence classes without loss of expressive power.

---

## 2.4 Closure Under Operation

**Constraint:** The grammar must be closed under its own operations.

Any operation definable within UNS must yield results that remain within the domain of the grammar. No operation may require reference to external elements, meta-symbols, or auxiliary systems to remain well-defined.

This constraint ensures that the grammar can express closed structures without implicit dependence on an outside domain.

---

## 2.5 Reflexive Capacity

**Constraint:** The grammar must be capable of representing structures that include reference to their own descriptions.

UNS must allow symbols, relations, or constructions that can participate in higher-order relations involving themselves, without producing inconsistency by default. This does not require unrestricted self-reference; it requires that reflexive constructions are expressible as part of the grammar’s normal operation.

The constraint is satisfied if reflexivity can be represented structurally, without appeal to meta-languages or external interpretive layers.

---

## 2.6 Non-Privileged Elements

**Constraint:** No element of the grammar may be privileged as an absolute origin, global reference frame, or external evaluator.

All symbols and relations within UNS must be subject to the same formal rules. The grammar may not rely on a distinguished element whose role is exempt from relational specification.

This constraint preserves internal symmetry of treatment while allowing structural asymmetry to be expressed.

---

## 2.7 Finite Specification, Open Extension

**Constraint:** The grammar must admit finite specification while allowing unbounded extension.

UNS must be definable by a finite set of rules or constructions, even if the structures it generates or represents are unbounded. This ensures that the grammar is usable and specifiable without limiting its expressive scope.

---

## 2.8 Summary of Assumptions

Taken together, these constraints define the design space within which the Universal Number Set is constructed. They do not assert that reality satisfies these properties; they assert that **if** one wishes to formally express a relational, asymmetric, closed, and reflexive ontology, then a grammar must satisfy constraints of this general kind.

The sections that follow introduce the formal definitions and structures that realize these constraints in one specific way. Alternative realizations are possible, and UNS should be evaluated accordingly: as a grammar, not as a foundation.
