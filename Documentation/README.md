| `UNS_Module_4_Final.md` | Details structural invariants, cancellation, and helper utilities. |
| `UNS_Module_5_Final.md` | Covers collections, aggregates, and higher-order constructions. |
| `UNS_Module_6_Final.md` | Explores dimensional transforms, reflexive views, and embeddings. |
| `UNS_Module_7_Final.md` | Focuses on runtime semantics, normalization pipelines, and evaluation. |
| `UNS_Module_8_Final.md` | Presents advanced operators, field analogues, and integration with observers. |
| `UNS_Module_9_Final.md` | Machine-first considerations and runtime execution pathways. |
| `UNS_Collections_Aggregates_Addendum.md` | Supplemental guidance on aggregate behaviors and collection patterns. |
| `License.md` | Licensing terms governing redistribution of the module texts. |

Each module builds on the prior one; read sequentially for the full formal development of UNS.
