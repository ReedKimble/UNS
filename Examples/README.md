# UNS Example Programs

This directory collects runnable `.unse` programs that illustrate core Universal Number Set behaviors. Use them directly with the CLI runtime or the Web App IDE.

| File | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| `sample1.unse` | Minimal program demonstrating constants, states, and readout. |
| `divide by zero.unse` | Shows how UNS emits novel values when classical division fails. |
| `d-transform invariance.unse` | Exercises dimensional transforms to confirm readout invariance. |
| `injected diff pattern.unse` | Explores differential patterns using lifted operators. |
| `prime distribution.unse` | Encodes a microstate distribution aligned with prime-counting intuition. |
| `hypotenuse.unse` | Replicates the classical Euclidean calculation via UNS expressions. |
| `smoothness detection.unse` | Uses helper masks to observe distribution smoothness. |
| `Web App IDE/` | Browser-based IDE (`uns_runtime_app.html`) with compiler, VM, and visualization panes. |
| `License.md` | Terms governing use of the example programs. |

Load any file into the runtime playground referenced in the main README to inspect intermediate values, states, and readouts.
