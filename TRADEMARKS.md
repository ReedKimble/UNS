UNS Trademarks and Branding
===========================

The following names and marks are used in this repository as identifiers of
origin and conceptual authorship:

  - "Universal Number Set"
  - "UNS"
  - Any associated logos or wordmarks explicitly designated in this project

These names and marks are reserved by the original author (Reed Kimble) and
are NOT granted for use as your own project name, company name, or primary
brand identifier without explicit permission.

You MAY:

  - Refer to "Universal Number Set (UNS)" accurately when describing this
    project or your implementations.
  - State that your software "implements UNS", "is compatible with UNS", or
    "is based on the UNS specification", provided such statements are true.

You MAY NOT:

  - Present your project *as if it were* the official UNS reference project
    without permission.
  - Use "Universal Number Set", "UNS", or any confusingly similar mark as
    your primary product name, organization name, or brand without explicit
    prior written permission.
  - Use the UNS name or marks in a way that is misleading about origin,
    sponsorship, or endorsement.

These trademark-style restrictions are separate from and in addition to the
copyright and open licenses (MIT and CC BY 4.0) that apply to the code and
documentation.

If you are unsure whether your use is appropriate, please contact the author
for clarification.
