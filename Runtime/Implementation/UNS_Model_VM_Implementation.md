# UNS Model & Virtual Machine Implementation Plan

This document captures an actionable model and VM blueprint derived from `UNS_Module_9_Machine_First.md` and `UNS_Runtime32_Spec.*`. It is written to be consumption-ready for both humans and tooling.

---

## 1. Runtime Constants & Encodings

| Concept | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `Word32` | signed 32-bit integer, two's complement |
| Fixed-point | Q16.16 (scale factor 65536) |
| `encodeReal(r)` | `Math.round(r * 65536)` |
| `decodeReal(w)` | `w / 65536` |
| Complex scalar | tuple `(real: Word32, imag: Word32)` |
| Microstates `M` | implementation parameter (default 8 in the SPA) |

Helper ops:

```text
addQ16(a,b) = (a + b)
subQ16(a,b) = (a - b)
mulQ16(a,b) = (a * b) >> 16
divQ16(a,b) = (a << 16) / b  (b != 0)
mag2(c) = mulQ16(c.real, c.real) + mulQ16(c.imag, c.imag)
```

### Note on the JavaScript engines

Both shipped JS runtimes—`Runtime/api/src/runtime/core.js` (Node/CLI) and `Examples/Web App IDE/uns_runtime_app.html` (browser)—implement the table above by immediately encoding every `Number` back into Q16.16 via `encodeReal`, `clampWord`, and friends. The host language still performs intermediate math in IEEE‑754 double precision, but every observable value is coerced into the 32‑bit fixed-point domain before it touches heap storage or helpers. We keep this pattern for simplicity and portability.

If stronger guarantees are required, two drop-in strategies remain viable:

1. Store microstate buffers inside `Int32Array` (or apply bitwise ops) so each arithmetic step explicitly masks to 32 bits even in JavaScript.
2. Push the math core into WebAssembly/native code to obtain true single-precision or integer ALU semantics.

Either option would be more “pure” with respect to the spec, but they add complexity without changing the logical model. For now both JS engines stay on the encode/clamp path.

---

## 2. Core Data Structures

```text
Complex32 = { real: Word32, imag: Word32 }
UValue32  = Complex32[M]
UState32  = Complex32[M]
ValueRef  = {
  kind: "scalar" | "uvalue" | "ustate" | "novel",
  payload: Complex32 | HeapId | NovelId
}
NovelEntry = { id, op, args, index }
Environment = Map<string, ValueRef>
```

Heap layout:

- `heap.values`: dense array of `UValue32`
- `heap.states`: dense array of `UState32`
- `heap.novels`: dictionary of `NovelEntry`

Allocation returns handles `HeapId = number`.

---

## 3. Instruction Set (stack-based)

| Opcode | Stack effect | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PUSH_SCALAR re im` | `[] -> [Scalar]` | Push complex scalar |
| `MAKE_CONST_UVALUE` | `[Scalar] -> [UValue]` | Fill microstates with scalar |
| `MAKE_STATE` | `[] -> [UState]` | Allocate default normalized state |
| `UVALUE_TO_STATE` | `[UValue] -> [UState]` | Copy amplitudes into state heap, then normalize |
| `LOAD name` | `[] -> [Value]` | Push env binding |
| `STORE name` | `[Value] -> []` | Bind env name |
| `UADD` | `[UValue,UValue] -> [UValue]` | +u |
| `UMUL` | `[UValue,UValue] -> [UValue]` | *u |
| `SSCALE` | `[Scalar,UValue] -> [UValue]` | *s (scalar first) |
| `LIFT1 func` | `[UValue] -> [UValue]` | lift unary function |
| `LIFT2 func` | `[UValue,UValue] -> [UValue]` | lift binary function |
| `READ` | `[UState,UValue] -> [Scalar]` | read(f | psi) |
| `NORM_STATE` | `[UState] -> [UState]` | normalize in-place |
| `D_TRANSFORM n` | `[UState] -> [UState]` | D(n, psi) |
| `HALT` | stop | end program |

Novel propagation occurs in `LIFT*` and `UMUL` when zero-divisions or undefined cases happen.

---

## 4. Compilation Pipeline

1. **Tokenizer** — produces tokens (keywords, identifiers, literals, operators).
2. **Parser** — builds AST with node kinds: `Program`, `LetDecl`, `StateDecl`, `Read`, `Lift1`, `Lift2`, `Const`, `Binary`, `DTransform`, `Identifier`, `ScalarLiteral`.
3. **Type tagging** — determines whether expressions produce scalars, values, or states (lightweight, heuristic-driven for the SPA).
4. **Instruction selection** — recursive descent emitting opcodes per AST pattern.
5. **VM Execution** — runs opcodes using the stack/heap/environment model above.

---

## 5. Normalization & Readout Algorithms

### Normalize State

```
normState(id):
  psi = heap.states[id]
  sum = 0
  for each c in psi:
    sum += mag2(c)
  if sum == 0: fill psi with uniform constant 1/M
  scale = invSqrt(sum)
  for each c in psi:
    c.real = mulQ16(c.real, scale)
    c.imag = mulQ16(c.imag, scale)
```

### Readout

```
read(uValId, stateId):
  f = heap.values[uValId]
  psi = heap.states[stateId]
  accReal = accImag = 0
  for i in 0..M-1:
    psi2 = mag2(psi[i])
    accReal += mulQ16(f[i].real, psi2)
    accImag += mulQ16(f[i].imag, psi2)
  return Complex32(accReal, accImag)
```

---

## 6. Lifting Hooks

Unary library provided in SPA:

- `sqrt`, `sin`, `cos`, `log`, `conj` (per microstate) with fallbacks to `Novel` when undefined.

Binary library:

- `divide`, `pow`, `max`, `min`, `phaseBlend` (demo), each returning `Novel` entries when inputs invalid.

Novel entries keep: `{ op, args: [Complex32…], index }`.

---

## 7. SPA Integration Summary

The single-page app wires the above model into an interactive surface:

1. Users edit UNS text.
2. Clicking **Compile & Run** drives tokenizer → parser → compiler → VM.
3. Execution artifacts feed UI panes:
   - Output scalar (`Complex32`, decoded to floats)
   - Expression tree (`JSON.stringify(AST)`).
   - Value tracker (environment table with handles & decoded samples).
   - Read tester (select `UValue` + `UState` to invoke VM `read`).
   - Debug log (token stream, emitted opcodes, vm trace).

The app also exposes `Sample Program` to demonstrate the workflow.

This blueprint is directly implemented in `uns_runtime_app.html` in this workspace.

## 8. UNS Operator Extensions (Spec + Library)

To keep the core UNS definition intact while providing a standard toolkit, the runtime now ships with two layers of operators:

### 8.1 Spec-Level Core Operators

1. `NORM(x)` – Normalizes any nonnegative vector to the simplex. When the sum of components is zero, it deterministically returns the uniform vector of matching dimension.
2. `MIX(u, v; α)` – Formalized convex mix, clamping `α ∈ [0,1]` and preserving the simplex invariant.
3. `MERGE({u^{(j)}}, {w_j})` – Weighted combination of UNS elements followed by `NORM`. Weights default to 1 and must be nonnegative.
4. `SPLIT(u; {α_j})` – Produces subnormalized components `α_j u` where the `α_j` form a simplex. Callers can re-normalize individual slices via `NORM` if a standalone UNS element is required.
5. `CANCEL(u, v)` plus optional `CANCEL_JOINT(u, v)` – Removes overlap via `OVERLAP`, renormalizes residuals with `NORM`, and keeps symmetry guarantees.

### 8.2 Helper Utilities

- `OVERLAP(u, v)` – Component-wise minima driving the cancellation process.
- `MASK(u; m)` and `PROJECT(u; S)` – Apply nonnegative masks (or subset indicators) followed by `NORM` with the same zero-sum fallback.
- `DOT(u, v)` and `DIST_L1(u, v)` – Read-only observables confined to `[0, 1]`; useful for steering higher-level algorithms without altering UNS data.

### 8.3 Validation & Testing

The SPA reference implementation includes automated checks that:

- Confirm nonnegativity and unit-sum invariants for every UNS-returning operator.
- Assert that `CANCEL` is symmetric (residuals swap when arguments swap).
- Bound the metrics (`DOT`, `DIST_L1`) inside `[0,1]` even under floating-point noise.

These additions keep the mathematical meaning of UNS untouched while standardizing the everyday manipulations engineers need when composing programs or debugging microstates.
