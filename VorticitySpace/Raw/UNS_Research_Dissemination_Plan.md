## 🧭 Objective

To formally introduce the **Universal Number Set (UNS)** as a new mathematical framework derived from a single completeness axiom, and to initiate collaborative, empirical investigation into its potential to unify quantum, relativistic, and cosmological phenomena.

## ✅ Current Status

| Aspect | Status | Next Step |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Mathematical Formalism** | ✅ Core invariant defined (Σ |v|² = 1); field and reflexive operators complete. | ☐ Peer mathematical review and publication in open-access preprint archive. |
| **Logical Consistency** | ✅ Internal consistency confirmed; Gödel fixed-point resolution demonstrated. | ☐ Solicit independent formal logic verification. |
| **Empirical Mapping** | ✅ Dimensional equilibrium, conservation, and dark energy mappings complete. | ☐ Simulation and numeric validation. |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Core papers and appendices written and reviewed. | ☐ Repository publication and DOI assignment. |

## 📣 Communication Strategy

| Channel | Purpose | Tone |
|----------|----------|------|
| **GitHub Repository** | Primary technical archive and community collaboration hub. | Open, technical, version-controlled. |
| **arXiv / OSF Preprints** | Formal academic dissemination. | Peer-facing, neutral. |
| **Medium / Substack (optional)** | Public outreach summary after initial peer feedback. | Accessible and conceptual. |
| **Conference Abstracts (2026 cycle)** | Introduce UNS to interdisciplinary forums. | Analytical and evidence-focused. |

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Collaborator Targets

| Discipline | Role |
|-------------|------|
| **Mathematicians (Category Theory, Topology)** | Analyze UNS as a self-complete relational category. |
| **Quantum Field Theorists** | Validate phase–curvature and normalization equivalence. |
| **Cosmologists** | Test normalization–Λ correlation numerically. |
| **Computer Scientists / Simulation Engineers** | Scale UNS runtime for distributed simulation. |
| **Philosophers of Science** | Examine the epistemic and ontological implications of completeness. |

## 🧩 Guiding Principles

- [x] **Understate, Don’t Oversell:** Present UNS as a consistent mathematical framework, not a “theory of everything.”  
- [x] **Invite Refutation:** Encourage falsifiable critique and replication.  
- [x] **Transparency:** Maintain open-source, reproducible, version-controlled data.  
- [x] **Two-Tier Language:** Use formal math for peers, conceptual summaries for outreach.

## 🗓 Short-Term Action Plan (Next 6 Weeks)

| Week | Objective | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Final proofreading and consistency audit of all Markdown papers. | ☐ |
| 2 | Push full repository with README, LICENSE, and runtime examples. | ☐ |
| 3 | Submit UNS paper to **arXiv**. | ☐ |
| 4 | Cross-post to **OSF**, assign DOI. | ☐ |
| 5 | Recruit 2–3 domain experts for theoretical audit. | ☐ |
| 6 | Begin simulation validation and publish results in repo. | ☐ |

## 🌌 Long-Term Vision

If validated, Phase II research will focus on:
- UNS-based **numerical cosmology** (large-scale curvature modeling),  
- **quantum decoherence reconstruction**, and  
- **derivation of physical constants from first principles**.

This would establish the UNS as a foundational **unification framework** across physics and mathematics.

> **Mission Statement:**  
> “To test whether completeness — the simplest possible axiom — is sufficient to generate the full relational structure of physical reality.”
