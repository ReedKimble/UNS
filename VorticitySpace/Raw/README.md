# Vorticity Space Raw Archive

This folder preserves the original research artifacts that seeded the UNS formalism. Highlights include:

- `!_Vorticity_UNS_Reading_Order.md` — Recommended sequence for navigating the archive.
- `00_Original_VorticitySpace_Hypothesis.rtf` and companion README — Foundational manuscripts describing the completeness axiom in vortex terms.
- Integration papers (`Vorticity_Space_and_the_Universal_Number_Set.md`, `Vorticity_Space_and_UNS_Integrated_Paper.md`) connecting early ideas to UNS math.
- Topic-specific studies (e.g., `Distributed_Normalization_and_the_Origin_of_Dark_Energy_in_UNS.md`, `Reflexive_Manifold_Hypothesis_...md`).
- Outreach artifacts such as `UNS_Collaboration_Invitation.md`, `UNS_Research_Dissemination_Plan.md`, and `UNS_Outreach_Science_Communicators.md`.
- Licensing terms in `LICENSE.md` — review before redistributing excerpts.

Each file retains its original tone and formatting; treat this directory as a historical reference layer that complements the cleaned, canonical documents elsewhere in the repo.
