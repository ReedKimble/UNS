## 🧭 Overview

This document accompanies the file:

> **`00_Original_VorticitySpace_Hypothesis.rtf`**

which represents the earliest written articulation of the **Vorticity Space** hypothesis — the conceptual precursor to what would later evolve into the **Universal Number Set (UNS)** framework.

It is preserved here for **historical transparency, authorship verification, and academic continuity**.  
The ideas expressed in that original RTF draft were intuitive, exploratory, and metaphorical — describing reality in terms of vortices, rotation, and self-interacting fields before a formal mathematical language existed to express those dynamics.

## 🧩 Purpose of Inclusion

This RTF manuscript is included to:

- Document the **intellectual origin** of the UNS framework.  
- Show the **evolution** from conceptual intuition to mathematical formalism.  
- Provide **context** for terminology (e.g., “vorticity,” “field,” “flow”) that has since been formalized as *relational curvature* and *normalization gradients* in UNS.  
- Demonstrate **authorship provenance**, as part of the open record of discovery.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The contents of this file **predate** all formal UNS documentation.  
- The descriptions within are **conceptual, not mathematical**, and may include metaphors no longer used in formal UNS terminology.  
- It should be read as **philosophical scaffolding**, not as a technical or empirical statement.  
- Some language may reflect early assumptions later revised or discarded during the UNS formalization process.

## 🧠 Historical Context

The **Vorticity Space** hypothesis was originally written as a speculative exploration of how self-organizing rotation and flow could give rise to the structures of reality.  
While its vocabulary was qualitative, the underlying intuition — that differentiation and balance must arise within a closed system — provided the key insight that later became formalized in UNS as the **Completeness Axiom**:

\[
\sum_i |v_i|^2 = 1
\]

From that axiom, the UNS framework ultimately derived dimensional equilibrium, conservation laws, and the reflexive observer model.

Thus, this RTF represents the **conceptual origin point** of the modern UNS theory.
