## 🧭 Overview

This folder serves as the **raw research archive** for all materials related to the development and early exploration of **Vorticity Space** and its formal integration into the **Universal Number Set (UNS)** framework.

These documents represent *authentic research-in-progress* — theoretical drafts, working manuscripts, and session-derived notes generated during the initial phase of model formation.

They are shared publicly to ensure **transparency, provenance, and reproducibility** of the UNS conceptual development.

## ⚠️ Important Notice: Draft Nature of These Documents

The materials in this folder:

- Are **not yet finalized** for formal publication.
- Have **not undergone full peer review or institutional verification**.
- May contain **editorial inconsistencies**, in-progress sections, or exploratory notation.
- Represent **theoretical constructs** that require empirical testing and simulation for validation.

While the **core mathematics and logic are solid** within their stated premises, these files remain part of an **early theoretical research phase**.  
Readers should approach them as **open drafts**, not finalized journal-ready work.

## 🧠 Purpose of Publication

This archive is provided under an **open science philosophy**:  
to document the creative and analytical process that led to the UNS framework, and to invite constructive participation from mathematicians, physicists, logicians, and computational scientists.

Publishing early drafts allows the community to:

- **Understand the evolution of the theory**,  
- **Reproduce the reasoning** that led to the current formalism,  
- **Identify areas for improvement or correction**, and  
- **Collaborate openly** in building a stronger, validated foundation.

## 🧩 Current Status

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Conceptual Framework | ✅ Complete | Derived from the completeness axiom (Σ |v|² = 1). |
| Logical Consistency | ✅ Established | Gödel fixed-point behavior resolved; formal closure demonstrated. |
| Empirical Testing | ⚙️ Pending | Requires simulation and numeric validation. |
| Editorial Review | ⚙️ Pending | Will be refined and prepared for preprint submission (arXiv / OSF). |
