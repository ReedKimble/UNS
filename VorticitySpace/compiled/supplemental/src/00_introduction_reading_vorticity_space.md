# Introduction

This document is an interpretive guide to the *Vorticity Space* corpus.

It does not introduce new ontological claims, extend the ontology presented in *Vorticity Space*, or provide justification for that ontology. Its sole purpose is to clarify how the corpus is structured, how its components relate to one another, and how the material should be read without importing inappropriate expectations or evaluative criteria.

The corpus is intentionally layered. Each layer addresses a distinct class of questions and operates under different constraints. Confusion most often arises when material from one layer is read as if it were answering questions that belong to another. This introduction exists to prevent that category error before it occurs.

At the core of the corpus is *Vorticity Space*, which establishes an ontological foundation by identifying structural necessities required for coherent existence. These claims are necessity-based, not evidentiary. They are evaluated by closure and coherence, not by empirical confirmation, formal derivation, or practical success.

Surrounding this core are documents that serve three secondary roles:

- **Interpretive orientation**, which explains how the ontology should be read and what kinds of questions it does and does not answer.
- **Structural boundary enforcement**, which distinguishes ontological necessity from formal expression and application.
- **Downstream contextualization**, which situates formal systems and implementations as consequences of the ontology rather than as its justification.

These supporting documents are not extensions of the ontology. They do not add content to it, strengthen it, or defend it. They exist to reduce misunderstanding, not to increase authority.

The order in which these documents are presented reflects dependency, not importance. Ontology constrains formalism; formalism constrains application. Nothing in the corpus flows in the opposite direction. Readers are encouraged to respect this ordering and to evaluate each document only within the scope it claims.

If read with this structure in mind, the corpus is coherent and complete. If read as a single linear argument, a theory seeking validation, or a body of work optimized for institutional norms, it will appear fragmented or evasive. That appearance is a function of mismatched expectations, not missing content.

This introduction should be read once, at the beginning. Its role is purely orienting. After that, the documents that follow are best engaged directly, each on its own terms.
