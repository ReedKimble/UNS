# Ontological Summary

This document has advanced a minimal ontological account grounded in necessity rather than description. Its claims do not depend on particular models, formalisms, or domains, but on the requirements that any coherent reality must satisfy in order to exist as a structured whole.

First, relationality is primary. Nothing exists in isolation; to exist is to be distinguishable, and distinguishability is a relational condition. Identity, persistence, and change arise from stable patterns of relation rather than from self-subsistent entities or substrates.

Second, asymmetry is necessary. Pure symmetry cannot sustain distinction or structure. Without asymmetry, relations collapse into equivalence and no differentiation can arise. Asymmetry provides orientation and consequence, enabling relations to matter internally.

Third, vortical structure follows from relationality and asymmetry under closure. To sustain differentiation without external anchors or terminal endpoints, relations must circulate. Rotational organization preserves distinction through continuity, allowing structure to persist and transform within a closed system.

Fourth, observers are internal. Any system capable of distinction must include the capacity to distinguish. Observation is not an external act imposed upon reality, but an internal configuration of relations through which the system differentiates itself. Observer inclusion is therefore a requirement of completeness, not an epistemic complication.

Fifth, closure stabilizes self-reference. When a system contains its own descriptions as part of its relational structure, self-reference ceases to be problematic. Stability is achieved not by eliminating self-reference, but by integrating it evenly so that no distinction claims external authority.

Taken together, these claims describe a reality that is relational, asymmetric, vortical, observer-inclusive, and self-closing. None of these features are optional, and none are derived from contingent facts about particular worlds. They are structural necessities implied by the possibility of coherent existence itself.

What follows does not extend this ontology. The final section clarifies how subsequent works relate to it, and why they are properly understood as downstream realizations rather than foundations.
