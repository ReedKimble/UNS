# Ontological Posture: Completeness and Coherence

This work adopts a specific ontological posture: that any account of reality must be complete in order to be coherent, and coherent in order to be meaningful. Completeness here does not imply exhaustiveness of description, nor total knowledge of particulars. It refers instead to structural closure: the requirement that nothing essential to the existence or operation of the system is placed outside the system itself.

A system is coherent if it can account for its own distinctions, relations, and continuities without appeal to undefined external sources. Any ontology that depends on an unexplained outside—whether a privileged observer, a foundational substance, or an irreducible exception—fails this criterion. Such accounts defer the problem of existence rather than resolving it.

Completeness, in this sense, precedes correctness. A description may be internally consistent yet incomplete if it relies on assumptions it cannot itself ground. Conversely, a complete ontology may admit multiple correct descriptions, models, or interpretations without being reducible to any one of them. Completeness concerns what must be included for existence to close; correctness concerns how a particular description aligns with some chosen representation.

From this posture, distinctions that have no observable or relational consequence within the system are treated as ontologically empty. If a difference cannot participate in relation, cannot affect structure, and cannot be engaged from within the system, it does not belong to the ontology of that system. This is not a claim about knowledge or perception, but about existence as such.

Coherence therefore requires that every distinction drawn by the ontology be actionable within it. Entities, properties, or dimensions that cannot, even in principle, enter into relation introduce asymmetries of explanation rather than asymmetries of structure. They mark points where the account ceases to explain and instead gestures outward.

The remainder of this document proceeds from this posture. Each subsequent claim is evaluated not by appeal to external validation, but by whether its absence would leave the ontology structurally open or incoherent. In this way, completeness and coherence serve as the sole governing criteria for what follows.
