# Relationality as Primary

Any ontology that begins with isolated entities must subsequently explain how those entities relate. This reversal places relation as a secondary feature, derived from prior individuality. Such an approach cannot close without remainder: relations are either imposed externally or treated as additional primitives, fragmenting the account.

This work adopts the opposite posture. Relation is ontologically primary. What exists is not first a collection of self-contained things, but a web of distinctions constituted through relation. Identity is not antecedent to relation; it is an outcome of relational differentiation.

A distinction only exists insofar as it participates in relation. To be something is to be distinguishable from something else, and distinguishability is itself a relational condition. An entity with no relations—no contrasts, no interactions, no contextual placement—is indistinguishable from non-existence within the system. Relationality is therefore not an added feature of existence, but its minimal requirement.

From this perspective, properties are not intrinsic possessions of objects but stable patterns of relation. Persistence is not the endurance of a substance, but the continuity of relational structure across differentiation. Change is not the alteration of a thing-in-itself, but a reconfiguration of relations within a closed system.

Relational primacy also removes the need for a privileged substrate. When relations are fundamental, no underlying material, medium, or absolute reference frame is required to ‘carry’ them. Any such substrate would itself need to be related to what it supports, reintroducing the same problem at a deeper level. Ontological economy is achieved not by positing fewer kinds of things, but by refusing to posit anything that cannot be relationally situated.

This stance does not deny the usefulness of object-based descriptions. It explains them. Objects, units, and boundaries arise as stable regions within a relational field, maintained by consistent patterns of differentiation. They are real insofar as the relations that constitute them are real, but they are not fundamental.

By treating relationality as primary, the ontology remains closed under its own terms. Every distinction, persistence, and interaction is accounted for without appeal to externally defined entities or irreducible primitives. The subsequent necessity of asymmetry follows directly from this commitment: without asymmetry, relation itself cannot differentiate, and structure cannot arise.
