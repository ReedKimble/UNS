# Downstream Work and Formal Realizations

The ontology presented in this document is complete in itself. It does not require formal machinery, mathematical structure, or empirical application to be coherent or justified. Nevertheless, a body of downstream work exists that takes the invariants described here and realizes them in specific formal, operational, or interpretive contexts.

These works do not ground the ontology of *Vorticity Space*. They presuppose it. The dependency is strictly outward: from ontological necessity to formal expression, not the reverse.

The **Universal Number Set (UNS)** provides a formal grammar capable of expressing relational, asymmetric, and reflexive structure in a representation-invariant way. It is a realization of the ontological commitments described here, not their foundation.

The **Convergent Grammar Principle (CGP)** offers a meta-level criterion for evaluating whether a given grammar captures structure invariant under multiple representations. It does not validate the ontology of *Vorticity Space*; it operates downstream as a tool for assessing formal sufficiency.

**UMAT** extends the ontological framework into an interpretive and existential domain, addressing questions of meaning, alignment, and coherence as they arise within reflexive systems. Its concerns are downstream and derivative, not ontological prerequisites.

**TOCO-EOD** expresses aspects of this ontology as an operational discipline, translating relational and reflexive structure into procedural form. It is an application of the invariants identified here, not an argument for them.

The **ProtoLanguage / SSP** documents explore communicative and linguistic applications of relational and vortical structure. They investigate how such structure manifests in high-dimensional communication systems, presupposing the ontological conditions established in this work.

The **Analog Computer** and **Manifold** materials represent concrete implementations and applications. They instantiate aspects of relational closure and observer inclusion in hardware and interactive systems. As implementations, they are furthest downstream and carry no justificatory weight for the ontology itself.

None of these works are required to read, accept, or critique *Vorticity Space*. They are mentioned solely to prevent confusion about direction of dependence. This document stands as the ontological spine of the corpus. All other works are elaborations, realizations, or applications that flow from it, never into it.
