## Citation Guidelines

To keep references consistent:

- **Markdown documents** (e.g., README, guided notes) should use footnote-style citations (e.g., `[^note]`) with the source defined at the bottom of the file. Reuse canonical references such as measure-theory or Hilbert-space texts where possible.
- **LaTeX documents** must cite entries from `Paper/uns_refs.bib`. Add new BibTeX entries there before referencing them in `.tex` files.
- When comparing UNS to classical frameworks, cite at least one primary source (e.g., Kolmogorov/Fomin for measure theory, von Neumann for Hilbert spaces) so readers can trace the lineage of the concepts.

Please keep citations lightweight in prose but sufficient to support claims about prior art.
